title: Component Library
---

KK supports turning any static website into an extension.

However, if you are building a custom UI extension from scratch it is recommended to use
KK's Component Library to keep the UI styling consistent with KK's design.

To keep the style consistent across different frameworks, KK uses TailwindCSS + Shadcn.

Shadcn has ports for multiple popular frontend frameworks. For now, KK supports React, Vue, and Svelte.

Shadcn adds component source code to your project, so you can customize the component as you like,
but I want to make it easy for developers to use the components without worrying about dealing with the component files.

So I created component libraries wrapping Shadcn components for React, Vue, and Svelte so you can import components directly.

:::note
Since the component libraries are just wrappers around Shadcn components, the usage is pretty much exactly the same.
I won't build a full documentation for each library. A few examples are provided for each library in the following pages.

To see the full list of components, please refer to the Shadcn documentation.

- [Shadcn React](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [Shadcn Vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/)
- [Shadcn Svelte](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/)

:::tip
If you use the KK's provided scaffolding CLI [**create-kunkun**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-kunkun) to create a new project, the component libraries are already installed and ready to use.
