Database API is for extensions that need to store data in a database.

Please avoid using browser storage like `localStorage` to avoid data collisions with other extensions and data leaks.

**Database API doesn't require any permissions, but one extension can only access its own data.**

This database is based on sqlite, for a key-value style storage, see [KV API](/developer/api/kv).

The following APIs are now available:

- `add`
- `delete`
- `search`
- `retrieveAll`
- `retrieveAllByType`
- `deleteAll`
- `update`

CRUD are the basic operations provided by the database API. Let's talk about them one by one.

## Add

There are 3 parameters for each data entry:

- `data`
  - Any data you want to store.
- `dataType`
  - An arbitrary string to categorize the data.
- `searchText`
  - A string to search the data. You can use this to store preview data as well.
  - This field is searchable via sqlite full-text search.

Only `data` is required. `dataType` and `searchText` are optional, and everything is stored as a string.

You need to use `JSON.stringify` to store objects, and `JSON.parse` to deserialize them.

> Later I may provide a way to store objects directly, but for now, you need to serialize them.

import ImportCodeBlock from '@/components/api/import-code-block.astro'

<ImportCodeBlock apiName="db" />

```ts
await db.add({
  data: JSON.stringify({ name: "Kunkun" }),
  dataType: "preference",
  searchText: "preference",
});
```

:::caution
Since the database API is not a key-value store. `dataType` isn't a unique key.
Running `.add()` multiple times with the same data will create multiple entries.

If you need to make sure there is a single entry, please use the [KV API](/developer/api/kv) instead.
:::

## Read/Search

There are multiple APIs to read data from the database.

- `db.retrieveAll` returns all data entries for the extension.
  Sometimes the extension may store large amount of data in the `data` field, while you may only need the `searchText`.
  So a `fields` parameter is provided to specify which fields you want to retrieve.
- `db.retrieveAllByType` returns all data entries by `dataType`.
- `db.search` run search query within the database instead of retrieving all data and filtering them with JS.

```ts
const allData = await db.retrieveAll({
  fields: ["data", "search_text"],
});

const result = await db.search({ dataType: "preference" });

const result = await db.search({ dataType: "preference" });
```

### Search

`db.search` API supports searching on multiple fields. Use your IDE to go to the definition of `search()` to see the full type definition.

```ts
enum SQLSortOrder {
  ASC = "ASC",
  DESC = "DESC",
}

type SearchParams = {
  dataId?: number;
  fullTextSearch?: boolean;
  dataType?: string;
  searchText?: string;
  afterCreatedAt?: Date;
  beforeCreatedAt?: Date;
  limit?: number;
  orderByCreatedAt?: SQLSortOrder;
  orderByUpdatedAt?: SQLSortOrder;
  fields?: ExtDataField[];
};
```

- `dataId` is the unique ID of the data entry.
- `fullTextSearch` is a boolean to enable full-text search on the `searchText` field.
- `limit` is the maximum number of results to return.
- `fields` is an array of fields to return.

## Update

You need to provide the `dataId` to update the data.

```ts
await db.update({ dataId: 803, data: "new data", searchText: "new data" });
```

## Delete

You need to provide the `dataId` to delete the data.

```ts
await db.delete(803);
```
