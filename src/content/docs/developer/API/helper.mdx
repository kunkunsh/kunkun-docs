This API contains some helper functions to help you guide users to install the dependencies.

Your extension may depend on some common dependencies like Homebrew, Deno, FFmpeg, etc.

You can implement your own guide functions to guide users to install the dependencies.

Or you can use the following APIs to guide users to KK's builtin guides.

## APIs

- `guideInstallDeno`
- `guideInstallFfmpeg`
- `guideInstallHomebrew`
