title: Security

**Docs:** https://docs.api.kunkun.sh/interfaces/index.ISecurity

This API provides some security and privacy utility functions.

Extensions inherit system permissions from the host app (Kunkun)
Some features may require access to sensitive permissions, while Kunkun may not have access to them.

With security API, you can check if certain permissions are granted to Kunkun and reveal the security pane to let user grant them.

For example, on MacOS, if your extension needs to take screenshots or record screen, user has to grant screen capture permission to Kunkun.
Otherwise, the content captured will be empty. 

A `verifyFingerprint()` API is also provided to verify the fingerprint of the current user. If your extension stores any sensitive data, 
you may want to verify the fingerprint to ensure the user is the one who is using the extension.

## Platforms

:::caution
MacOS has more security limitations that could affect the usage of extensions, currently this security API is only for MacOS.
:::

- [x] MacOS
- [ ] Windows
- [ ] Linux

## API and Permissions

import SecurityApiList from "@/components/api/security-api-list.astro"

<SecurityApiList />

## Usage

Here is a simple demo to ask user for screen capture permission and reveal the security pane.

import ImportCodeBlock from '@/components/api/import-code-block.astro'

<ImportCodeBlock apiName="security" />

```ts
const verified = await security.mac.verifyFingerprint()
const hasPermission = await security.mac.checkScreenCapturePermission()
if (hasPermission) {
    const granted = await security.mac.requestScreenCapturePermission()
    // or
    await security.mac.revealSecurityPane("ScreenCapture")
}

// Sometimes, if user denies a permission, the prompt won't show up the next time. 
// You can reveal the security pane.
// If you still want the prompt to show up, you may want to reset the permission.
await security.mac.resetPermission("ScreenCapture")
```
