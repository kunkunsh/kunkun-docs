KV API is a persistent key-value store for extensions similar to `localStorage`.

Please avoid using browser storage like `localStorage` to avoid data collisions with other extensions and data leaks.

**KV API doesn't require any permissions, but one extension can only access its own data.**

:::tip
FYI: The KV API is just a wrapper over the [Database API](/developer/api/db), which is built on top of sqlite.
The `dataType` field is `kunkun_kv`, so if you want to access KV store data using the Database API, you can set `dataType` to `kunkun_kv` in search query.
:::

The following APIs are now available:

- `add`
- `get`
- `exists`
- `delete`

## Sample Code

```ts
kv.exists("test").then((exists) => {
  console.log("KV exists:", exists);
});
kv.set("test", Math.random().toString()).then(() =>
  kv.get("test").then((value) => {
    console.log("KV value:", value);
  });
);
```

:::caution
The data is stored as JSON string in database, so data passed to `set` must be serializable with `JSON.stringify`.
It doesn't have to be a string, but it will be converted to string when stored, and `JSON.parse` will be called when retrieved.
