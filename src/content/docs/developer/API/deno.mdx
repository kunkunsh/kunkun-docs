:::tip
Deno API is part of the shell API and works similarly but provides a easier abstraction, you may want to read [shell API](/developer/api/shell) first.
:::

## API and Permissions

All [Deno permissions](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/security/) must be explicitly declared in `package.json`.

`DenoCommand` works similarly to a regular [shell Command](/developer/api/shell#command). It can be created with `shell.createDenoCommand`.

The returned `DenoCommand` object has `execute` and `spawn` methods (just like regular `Command`).

To run a Deno command, you need one of the the following scoped permissions:

- `shell:deno:execute`
- `shell:deno:spawn`

Read [sample code](#sample-code) for more details.

### RPC Library Style API

> If you're looking to run Deno as a library for resource-intensive tasks or those requiring system access, the Deno API offers a solution. You can execute Deno scripts using `shell.createDenoCommand`, passing input through `argv` and `stdin`, and retrieving results via `stdout` and `stderr`. This approach essentially treats Deno like a CLI, as illustrated in an example (Transform Image with Sharp) provided below.
> However, using a CLI is not always ideal for those who prefer calling scripts directly like a typical library. The `@kksh/api` solves this by offering an abstraction in RPC style, allowing Deno scripts to be invoked as libraries rather than CLIs.

The shell API provides a function siganture `createDenoRpcChannel` that creates a Deno RPC API.

```ts
function createDenoRpcChannel<LocalAPI extends {}, RemoteAPI extends {}>(
  scriptPath: string,
  args: string[],
  config: Partial<DenoRunConfig> & SpawnOptions,
  localAPIImplementation: LocalAPI
): Promise<RPCChannel<LocalAPI, RemoteAPI>>
  // ...
}


```

Then you can call the remote API functions directly.

- Since this is a bidirectional IPC channel, you can pass `LocalAPI` and `RemoteAPI` generics to define the API.
  - `LocalAPI` is what you want to expose to the other side of the channel, and `RemoteAPI` is what you want to call from the other side.
- `args` are `argv` like regular commands
- `config` is the same as config in `shell.createDenoCommand`, used for configuring deno permissions and other options.
- `localAPIImplementation` is the implementation of the API you want to expose, pass `{}` if you don't want to expose any API.

Suppose we want to build a math library in Deno and call it from extension running in web worker or iframe.

Here is how the library will be written in Deno. Just provide an API object.

:::caution
All API methods must be `async` functions (return `Promise`), otherwise the return type will be wrong.
:::

```ts title="types.ts"
export interface MathLibAPI {
	add(a: number, b: number): Promise<number>
	subtract(a: number, b: number): Promise<number>
}
```

#### Deno Script

I recommend use a separate subdirectory for Deno scripts to avoid confusion with regular extension code. I will use `deno-src` in this example.

```bash
deno init deno-src
deno add jsr:@kunkun/api
```

This will create a import map in `deno.json`

```json title="deno-src/deno.json"
{
	"imports": {
		"@kunkun/api": "jsr:@kunkun/api@^x.x.x" // Use the latest version
	}
}
```

Kunkun's API package for Deno is on JSR, https://jsr.io/@kunkun/api
Note: the scope is `@kunkun` rather than `@kksh`. This is because `@kunkun` scope was taken on npm registry. 

`expose` function is provided by `@kunkun/api/runtime/deno` to expose the API object to its parent process.

```ts title="deno-src/math-lib.ts"
import { expose } from '@kunkun/api/runtime/deno'
import { type MathLibAPI } from "../types.ts"

// Define your API methods
export const mathLib: MathLibAPI = {
	add: async (a: number, b: number) => a + b,
	subtract: async (a: number, b: number) => a - b
}

expose(apiMethods)
```

`expose()` is a wrapper function for building a bidirectional RPC channel. It returns the `RPCChannel` object, 
which can be used to call API exposed from the other side of the channel.

<details>
<summary>Manual Channel Configuration</summary>

You shouldn't need to worry about how the channel is created, but here is how it's done manually.

It's based on `@hk/comlink-stdio` package, see https://jsr.io/@hk/comlink-stdio

```ts title="deno-src/math-lib.ts"
import { DenoStdio, RPCChannel } from "@hk/comlink-stdio"
import { type MathLibAPI } from "../types.ts"

// Define your API methods
export const mathLib: MathLibAPI = {
	add: async (a: number, b: number) => a + b,
	subtract: async (a: number, b: number) => a - b
}

const stdio = new DenoStdio(Deno.stdin.readable, Deno.stdout.writable)
const channel = new RPCChannel<MathLibAPI, {}>(stdio, mathLib)
const api = channel.getApi()
```
</details>

#### Extension Code

In main extension code, use `shell.createDenoRpcChannel` to start running a Deno script and get the API object.

import ImportCodeBlock from '@/components/api/import-code-block.astro'

<ImportCodeBlock apiName="deno" />

```ts title="extension.ts"
import { type MathLibAPI } from "./types.ts"

// ...
// First generic is Local API interface to expose to the other side of the channel. We set it to {} to not expose any API. Last function parameter is the implementation of the API, which we also set to {}
const { rpcChannel, process } = await shell.createDenoRpcChannel<
  {},
  MathLibAPI
>("$EXTENSION/deno-src/math-lib.ts", [], {
  allowRead: ["$DESKTOP/**"]
}, {});


const api = rpcChannel.getApi();
await api.add(1, 2).then(console.log); // 3
await api.subtract(1, 2).then(console.log); // -1

await process.kill() // please always remember to kill the Deno process, or it may run forever
```

:::danger
Please remember to kill the process manually after you are done using the API. 
Otherwise, the process could run in the background forever.

An auto process cleanup mechanism is implemented in Kunkun to auto kill all leftover processes when an extension quits, but it's still better to control it manually.

If you are using template worker extension command, you could store the process as a class instance variable, and kill it in `onBeforeGoBack()` hook.

I recommend spawning a new process when you need it and kill it immediately after to avoid problems.

## Sample Code

### Transform Image with Sharp

In this sample, we will transform an image with [sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/), which is not runnable in browser.

Suppose we have a template worker extension project with the following structure:

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<FileTree>
- src
  - deno-script.ts
  - index.ts
- ...
</FileTree>

`index.ts` is the entrypoint to the extension command, `deno-script.ts` is a script that will be executed by Deno.

```ts title="deno-script.ts"
import { parseArgs } from "jsr:@std/cli/parse-args"
import sharp from "npm:sharp"

const args = parseArgs(Deno.args)
console.log(args)

const input = args.i
const output = args.o

sharp(input).blur(10).resize(300, 300).toFile(output)
```

The deno script above is very simple, it takes in an input image path and output image path, 
then apply blur and resize and save to output path.

To run this sample directly with `deno`: 
```bash
deno run --allow-ffi \
  --allow-env=npm_package_config_libvips,CWD \
  --allow-read=/Users/user/Desktop/avatar.png src/deno-script.ts \
  -i ~/Desktop/avatar.png -o ~/Desktop/avatar.jpeg
```

In the command above, we need to grant fine-grained permissions to Deno. It's not a good idea to run Deno with all permissions.

#### Use Deno API

In the following sample code, we will use `shell.createDenoCommand` to create a Deno command with permission settings.

See https://docs.api.kunkun.sh/interfaces/index.DenoRunConfig for options you can pass to `shell.createDenoCommand`.

```ts title="index.ts"
import { shell, path, WorkerExtension } from "@kksh/api/ui/worker";

class ExtensionTemplate extends WorkerExtension {
  async load() {
    const denoCmd = shell.createDenoCommand(
      "$EXTENSION/src/deno-script.ts",
      ["-i=./avatar.png", "-o=./avatar-blur.jpeg"],
      {
        allowEnv: ["npm_package_config_libvips", "CWD"],
        allowRead: ["$DESKTOP"],
        allowAllFfi: true,
        cwd: await path.desktopDir(),
      }
    );
    const denoRes = await denoCmd.execute();
    console.log("stdout", denoRes.stdout);
  }
}
```

The above TypeScript code sets CWD to the desktop directory, but you don't have to. You can always just compute the absolute path for the input and output file.

`$EXTENSION` was used to refer to the directory of the extension. It will be translated to the real path of your extension root at runtime.

`$DESKTOP` is also a path alias that will be translated to the real path of your desktop at runtime.
You can find other path aliases in [file system API](/developer/api/fs#path-alias).

#### Permissions in package.json

To ensure that an extension operates within a restricted scope, it must declare the necessary permissions in the `package.json` file.
This step prevents the extension from executing any code beyond the predefined limits.

```ts title="package.json"
...
"permissions": [
  {
    "permission": "shell:deno:execute",
    "allow": [
      {
        "path": "$EXTENSION/src/deno-script.ts",
        "env": ["npm_package_config_libvips", "CWD"],
        "ffi": "*",
        "read": ["$DESKTOP"]
      }
    ]
  },
  ...
]
...
```

`path` is the path to the deno script to execute.

The rest of the permissions are from [Deno permissions](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/security/).

- `net`
- `env`
- `read`
- `write`
- `run`
- `ffi`
- `sys`

They are `string[]` or `"*"`, when set to `"*"`, it allows all.

For example, setting `"read": "*"` allows setting `allowAllRead` to true in `shell.createDenoCommand`, and will be translated to `--allow-read` in the code execution.

Setting `"read": ["$DESKTOP"]` allows you to set `allowRead: ["$DESKTOP"]` in `shell.createDenoCommand`, and will be translated to `--allow-read=/Users/user/Desktop` in the code execution.
