## Custom (Iframe) Extensions

**Docs:** https://docs.api.kunkun.sh/interfaces/ui.IUiIframe

### Built-in Buttons

A custom extension rendered with iframe will take up the entire view port of the window.

The extension provides a few optional built-in buttons to help users navigate and control the extension
if the extension does not provide its own navigation and control buttons.

- `showBackButton`
	- Show a back button to navigate back to the main page
	- Will close window if your extension runs in a separate window
- `showMoveButton`
	- Show a move button user can grab to move the app window around
	- Designed for scenarios where extension doesn't have a title bar
	- You can choose to make any element in your extension draggable as well
- `showRefreshButton`
	- Show a refresh button to reload the extension, could be useful during development

You can hide these buttons if you want to provide your own

- `hideBackButton`
- `hideMoveButton`
- `hideRefreshButton`

Here we use the back button as an example.

```ts
import { ui } from "@kksh/api/ui/iframe"

type CustomPosition = {
	top: number,
	right: number,
	bottom: number,
	left: number
}
type Position = "top-left" | "top-right" | "bottom-left" | "bottom-right" | CustomPosition;

await ui.showBackButton("bottom-right")
// or set custom position
await ui.showBackButton({
	top: 5,
	right: 5
})
// hide the back button if you want to provide your own
await ui.hideBackButton() 
```

### Navigation

```ts
import { ui } from "@kksh/api/ui/iframe"

/**
 * Will return to main page if the extension runs in the main window
 * Will close the window if the extension runs in a separate window
 */ 
ui.goBack()

/**
 * Will reload the window
 */
ui.reloadPage()
```

### Window Control

```ts
import { ui } from "@kksh/api/ui/iframe"

// maximize the window
ui.toggleMaximize()

// set window background to transparent
// if the extension also has a transparent background, this will make the extension appear to be floating
ui.setTransparentWindowBackground(true)
```

### Theme

Get KK's color theme, if your extension is using KK component libraries, 
you can set your extension theme to match KK's theme.

import UpdateUiTheme from "./snippets/update-ui-theme.mdx"

<UpdateUiTheme />

:::note
Dependending on which KK component library you are using, you may need to wrap your app with a `ThemeProvider` 
for the theme to take effect.

Read the component library documentation for more information.
