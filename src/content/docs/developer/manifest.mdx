:::caution
Kunkun is still in early development, the extension schema is not finalized yet, and could change any time.

I will try to make the schema as stable as possible, and backward compatible. But there is no guarantee in the current stage.

To get the schema for latest app release: `https://schema.kunkun.sh/`.

To get the nightly release for latest app in development: `https://schema.kunkun.sh/nightly/`.
:::

Kunkun extensions metadata are defined in `package.json`.

Writing manifest file in json without intellisense is error-prone and comfusing.

For better DX, I provide some tools for manifest file validation and intellisense.

## Json Schema

In the `package.json` of your extension, you can add a `$schema` field. In VSCode and most modern code editors,
this will enable intellisense for the fields in the manifest file.
Missing fields and wrong data types will be highlighted.

The schema will run through a validator during loading and publishing. Without a valid manifest file, you will not be able to develop or publish the extension.

```json title="package.json"
{
    "$schema": "https://schema.kunkun.sh",
    ...
}
```

If you don't want to include this in your `package.json`, you can also configure VSCode workspace setting

```json title=".vscode/settings.json"
{
  "json.schemas": [
    {
      "fileMatch": ["<path to extension>/package.json"],
      "url": "https://schema.kunkun.sh"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Key Fields

- `name` (`string`): The name of the extension.
- `version` (`string`): The version of the extension.
- `files` (`string[]`): The files to be included in the publish package. Only include necessary files. e.g. most of the time `["dist"]` is enough.
- `kunkun`: Add extension details and commands info here.

## Playground

Here are two playgrounds with schema enabled. You can validate your extension manifest or experiment with the intellisense.

:::caution
You should see a yellow wiggle line under the line 1 of this `package.json`. Hover over it to see the error message.

  />
</div>

### Sample Package JSON

Try removing the `description` field or change `kunkun` to `kk`. Error messages will be shown below.

import ManifestValidator from "../../../components/dev-tools/ManifestValidator.tsx";

<div className="not-content">
  <ManifestValidator client:only="react" />
</div>
