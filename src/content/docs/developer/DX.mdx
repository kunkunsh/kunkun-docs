title: Developer Experience
---

As a developer myself, I always want to make the development experience as smooth as possible.

**KK** is designed to be developer-friendly, with a focus on the following aspects:

1. Debugability
    - When I have a problem with some apps, I don't know what's going on behind the scenes, and wish there is log to help me debug.
    - **KK** will provide a log system to help you debug your extension as well as the app itself.
    - **[WIP]** Troubleshooters for common issues will be provided. They will analyze automatically and give you suggestions.
