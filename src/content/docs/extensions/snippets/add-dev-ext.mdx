title: Add Dev Extension to Kunkun
draft: true
---

Kunkun needs to know where your extension is located in order to load it. 
It's very easy to add an extension for development.

KK provides a built-in command: `Add Dev Extension`. 
Open it, on the page you can pick the extension folder.
KK will register the path to the extension.

Now go back to the main search in home page, you should see the extension loaded. Dev extensions should have a <span class="bg-green-600 px-1 dark:text-black text-white font-bold rounded-sm">DEV</span> tag.
