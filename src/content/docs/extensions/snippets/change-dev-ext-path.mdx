title: Change Dev Extension Path
draft: true
---

Dev extensions are not installed together with the extensions installed from the extension store.

They can be anywhere on your file system, but you need to tell KK where to find them.

Go to Settings -> Developer -> Installation, there is a field to **Set Dev Extension Path**.

Choose the parent folder containing your extension project.


import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

If you are using the `KunkunExtensions` repo, set it to `KunkunExtensions/extensions`.

<FileTree>
- KunkunExtensions
  - extensions
    - ext-qrcode
      - package.json
      - dist
    - ext-jwt
      - package.json
      - dist
</FileTree>

Now go back to the main search in home page, you should see the extension loaded. Dev extensions should have a <span class="bg-green-600 px-1 dark:text-black text-white font-bold rounded-sm">DEV</span> tag.

> For now, you can only have one dev path. In the future, we may support multiple dev paths.
