title: Publish Instruction
draft: true

For now, send a PR to [KunkunExtensions](https://github.com/kunkunsh/KunkunExtensions).
Add the source code in `extensions/` folder of this repo. 

To update the extension and republish, just update the version in `package.json` and send a PR again.

When the version is updated, CI will auto publish the extension to the extension store.


:::note
Later I plan to implement better extension publishing system that allows developers to use their own GitHub repo directly, and [`KunkunExtensions`](https://github.com/kunkunsh/KunkunExtensions)
will be a mirror of all extensions to make sure the published extensions always have source code available for review.
