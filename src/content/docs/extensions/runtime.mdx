We can't assume users have any JS runtime installed on their machine.

`@kksh/api` package provides tools to detect if there is NodeJS, Bun, Deno installed on the machine.
You can also check if other language runtimes/interpreters are installed.

If no JS runtime is installed and your extension really needs it. 
`@kksh/api` provides API to auto-install [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime (not globally, not added to `PATH`).
You can get `Bun` path. Bun is lighter, faster, supports TypeScript (so you can ship `.ts` files directly), 
supports WASM. As a drop-in replacement for NodeJS, it's a good choice for extensions.

`Deno` runtime may be supported in the future as it supports sandbox. It's safer if extensions really need to 
run code directly on the machine rather than within Kunkun app sandbox.
