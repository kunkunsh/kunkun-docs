The headless command is simply a [Template UI Command](/extensions/worker-template) without UI.

Use APIs exported from `"@kksh/api/headless"`.

Some APIs for rendering UI are removed in `"@kksh/api/headless"`.

It's useful for some simple tasks without needing to open a new page.

Run the project scaffolding command to create a new project with Worker Template Extension.

:::note
Currently, the headless command is just a simplified version of the [Template UI Command](/extensions/worker-template) by removing UI.
In the future, more features will be added to the headless command. Such as cron jobs, etc.

```bash
npm init kunkun@latest  # choose the template
```

## `package.json`

```json
{
    ...,
    "kunkun": {
        ...
		"identifier": "template-ext-headless",
		"permissions": [
			"clipboard:write-text"
		],
		"icon": {
			"type": "iconify",
			"value": "material-symbols:extensiontabler:code"
		},
		"headlessCmds": [
			{
				"name": "Template: Headless Command UUID",
				"main": "dist/index.js",
				"cmds": []
			}
		]
	},
    ...
}
```

## Sample UUID Extension

This simple extension simply generates a UUID v4 and copies it to the clipboard.
Thus why `"clipboard:write-text"` permission is required in `package.json`.

`HeadlessWorkerExtension` is the base class for headless commands.

```ts
import {
  clipboard,
  expose,
  HeadlessWorkerExtension,
  toast,
} from "@kksh/api/headless";
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from "uuid";

class UuidExt extends HeadlessWorkerExtension {
  async load() {
    const uuid = uuidv4();
    return clipboard
      .writeText(uuid)
      .then(() => {
        toast.success(`Copied UUID: ${uuid}`);
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        toast.error(`Failed to copy UUID: ${err}`);
      });
  }
}

expose(new UuidExt());
```
