Work In Progress

The project is still under early development, more permissions will be added in the future.

If you need any permissions or have any suggestions, plean open an issue on GitHub or reach out to me on discord. 
:::

If a permission requires access to system APIs such as clipboard, file system, etc.,
the extension must declare the permission in the `package.json` file, under `kunkun.permissions` field.
Go to [Manifest Validator](/developer/manifest) to experiment with the permissions.

The requested permissions will be shown to the user when the extension is installed.

Here is a list of all permissions and their descriptions. 
Some permissions are scoped (e.g. file system API has limited access to certain directories declared in the manifest).
To learn how to use them, read the API documentation.
