There are two types of extension commands for now:

1. Template UI Command
2. Custom UI Command

An extension can have many commands, or both Template UI command and Custom UI command.

## Template UI Command

[Template UI Command](./worker-template) is a kind of lightweight extension running in web worker,
following pre-defined template, making it easy to develop extension with consistent GUI.

> Choose this if you don't need complex UI. List View, Form View, Markdown View are provided.
> You can write vanilla JavaScript/TypeScript code to build GUI for extensions.

## Headless Command

[Headless Command](./headless-command) is a trimmed version of Template UI, the main difference for now is that it doesn't have UI.

> Choose this if you don't need UI.

## Custom UI Command

[Custom UI Command](./custom-ui-ext) is basically a web app. Kunkun is essentially running in a web browser.
Any web app can be loaded as an extension. You can use any front-end framework to build the UI (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Solid, etc).

> Choose this if you need complex UI. You can build any UI you want. Even transparent window is supported.

Any CSR/SSG web apps are directly supported. Existing web apps can be easily converted into Kunkun extensions
by adding configs in the manifest file.

Multipage app is also supported. You can do routing in your extension, where each route is a command.
